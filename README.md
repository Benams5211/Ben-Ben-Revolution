Ben Ben Revolution!!! (version 1.2.0)

By: Benams

**Compatibility:
TI 84 Plus CE

**Patch Notes: The dates show when I first gave the games to my friends in person, so versions 1.0.0-1.1.2 are not avaliable through Cemetech.
Version 1.0.0: "First Edition"- 3/11/2021
Version 1.1.0: "Big Funkin' Update"- Added "How to Play," "Other Stuff," an intro, and added arrows instead of numbers. 3/15/2021
Version 1.1.1: "DLC (Kind of) Update" - Added more to the intro and credits. Was not distrubuted.
Version 1.1.2: "Dance Baby, Dance Update" - Added Dancing Person in intro. 4/30/21
Version 1.1.3: "Fine Tuning Update" - Fixed the method of exiting No-Fail, added more intros and credits, added the display of version number in intro.
I forget when I first gave this to my friends, so the distribution date is unknown. 
Version 1.2.0: "The Oxiti Upd8" - Moved patch notes, how to play, and the to do list into the ReadMe. Removed a ton of random intros to make the file smaller.
Added a top five high score list for One and Done and Three Strikes modes. Story mode was added, and by the way the dude's name is Dancing Person. I also added him
to the gameplay screen in the bottom right corner, he strikes a pose as a visual cue to press the arrow keys. 10/5/21

**To Do List:
Yeah I don't really know what to add, put some ideas in the reviews if you think of anything cool. Or don't.

**How to Play:
Press the correct arrow key when the arrow moving up the screen lines up with the arrows standing still at the top. Think DDR, but less precise because it's a 
calculator. If you are too early, too late, or just straight up don't press anything, your miss count will go up by one. In One and Done mode, you can only miss
one arrow and in Three Strikes mode, you can miss three. In custom mode, you can decide how many misses you can have and the speed at which the arrows move. 
There are two suggestions at the top, 0.05 and 0.01. You can choose literally any number to enter there, just keep in mind that the number you enter is how long it
takes for an arrow to move up one row. So the smaller it is, the faster the arrows will go. In no fail, you can miss as many arrows as you want, as you cannot fail.
Great for practicing basic gameplay, or maybe to just see how high you can score. 

**Story Mode:
Welcome to The Ben Ben Revolution Tournament! Play your way through four cups, each with five challenging levels. Don't worry, you're not alone. Dancing Guy will 
be there to cheer you on and be with you while you prove yourself. Can you pass the Legend Test and be a champion? 

**Installation:
Drag the program on to your desktop. Then send it to your calculator using the Ti Connect software. 

**About: 
This program is inspired by Friday Night Funkin and DDR, entirely programed on my calculator.
*Simple to pick up and play
*Includes a ton of charm and fun details.
*The closest thing to playing FNF on your calculator, if that's what you're in to.
*Five modes of play, including an endless "no fail" mode and a custom mode.
*Updates to come, eventually.

**Insructions:
Run prgmBBR

**Bugs:
Report any bugs, problems, or annoyances in the comments of the program download page. 
Suggestions are also welcome.

**Other Notes:
This is my first game I've made in TI Basic, and I'm super excited that you thought it looked cool
enough to download. Please enjoy this game.
Thank you. 

1.2.0 NOTES UPDATE: HUGE shoutouts to Cemetech users Oxiti8 (whom I named this update after) and Schifitzel for reviewing my game. Without them, there would be
no story mode, no high scores, no Dancing Guy outside of intro, and it would take up a lot more space. From the bottom of my heart, I thank you two. And the 
other six people who downloaded my program. If this new version is still not satisfactory, let me know what I can do and maybe Version 1.3.0 will be named after you.

THANK YOU
